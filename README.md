Since my undergraduate education, I have had an interest in applying statistics in a business setting. With my continued passion for knowledge, I decided to further pursue mastery in data science, ML, and AI. My work experience in both industry and academia shows that I am well-equipped with analytical tools, along with a versatile background. I also demonstrate a strong time management ability due to balancing both work and school. 

In my free time I enjoy playing basketball, jogging, and watching f√∫tbol highlights.
